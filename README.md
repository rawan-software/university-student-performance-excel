University Student Performance Analysis (Excel)

 Project Overview
This project analyzes university student performance using an Excel-based analytical approach.
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes academic, behavioral, 
and lifestyle-related attributes to evaluate students’ academic outcomes.

The project focuses on calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) and applying conditional analysis 
to identify patterns affecting GPA and student success.

 Dataset Information
- Dataset Title: University Student Performance
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Rows: 140
- Columns: 12
- Key Fields: GPA, Attendance Percentage, Study Hours per Week, Gender, Stress Level

KPI Analysis
The following KPIs were calculated using Excel formulas:

- Average GPA  
- Pass Rate (%)  
- Average Attendance (%)  
- Average Study Hours per Week  

Each KPI is calculated dynamically using Excel formulas such as:
- AVERAGE
- COUNTIF
- COUNTA

 Conditional Analysis
Additional conditional metrics were analyzed to compare student performance across different categories:

- Average GPA by Gender (Male vs Female)
- Number of Passing Students (GPA ≥ 2.0)
- Count of High-Stress Students

This analysis helps highlight performance differences and identify potential risk factors.
